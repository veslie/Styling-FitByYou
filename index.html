<h1> Styling FitByYou</h1>
<div id="introduction">
<h2> When buying your clothes online, we can't always purchase based on how it looks on the model. Let's purchase based on how it looks on you. But how is that possible you ask.
</h2>
<ol>
   <li>  Take a few pictures that is equivalent to a full body picture from head to toe, back to front, side to side.</li>
   <li> Take a <em>full 360 video</em> to fill in whatever the camera did not catch</li>
   <li>  <strong>Load into out system</strong></li>
   <li> now you're all set, if you're shopping and the company uses our system your   body will be loaded onto that webpage, if you see something you would like to try on just click try on and it will be loaded onto your web body.
   </li>
   <li> if its to small it will let you know it simply can't fit, if to big I will show you how it will look
   </li>
</ol>

   <h3> websites already provide dimension size for clothing, the system now has your dimensions size, its a simple calculation that will allow it to know if it can fit your body size, and if it does how does it look on you. As for as look our system will use a very detail algorithm to allow you to visually see if your clothing is  on </h3>

<ul>
   <li> to tight/to loose </li>
   <li>how it looks on your body shape </li>
   <li> to long/to short</li>
   <li>how does it make your booty/hips/thighs/breast/stomach/arms look </li>
   <li>do the colors look good on you </li>
   <li> you will be able to visually match an accessorize before adding to your shopping cart
   </li>
</ul>
<h4> The algorithm will not be perfect, At the end of the day nothing works better than you actually trying on your clothes, but <a href="https://www.gonaibo.com/"target="_blank">FitByYou</a> come very close to it. And saves you time, energy, money
